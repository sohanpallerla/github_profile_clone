GitHub Profile Clone
This project is a GitHub profile page clone that replicates the layout and functionality of a typical GitHub user profile. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this clone showcases front-end development skills and provides an interactive, responsive UI similar to GitHub's profile pages.

Features
Profile Section: Displays the user's profile picture, name, bio, and basic details.
Repositories Overview: Shows a list of repositories with important stats like stars, forks, and issues.
Followers and Following: Displays the number of followers and following, along with clickable links to explore further.
Navigation Links: Provides easy access to other sections like repositories, followers, and more.
Responsive Layout: Adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Interactive Hover Effects: Provides visual feedback on hover to improve user interaction.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the page content.
CSS: For styling the page and making it responsive.
JavaScript: For interactive features and dynamic elements.

How It Works
The project uses HTML for the structure of the page, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive components.
The profile section is hardcoded, but you can modify it to include real data by integrating APIs such as the GitHub REST API for dynamic content.
The layout is designed to resemble GitHub's profile page, with separate sections for repositories, followers, and personal details.
Future Enhancements
Integrate GitHub's API to fetch real-time user profile data.
Add more interactive features like creating new repositories or managing profile details.
Enhance the design with additional UI elements and animations.
